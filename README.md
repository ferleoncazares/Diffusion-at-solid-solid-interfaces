# Diffusion-at-solid-solid-interfaces
Finite volume methods implemented in Matlab to model solute diffusion at solid-solid interfaces, accounting for energy barriers and interfacial segregation. The derivation of the models has been published in: https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.123802. Please cite this publication if you benefit from this repository.
