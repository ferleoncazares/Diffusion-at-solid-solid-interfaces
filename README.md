# Diffusion-at-solid-solid-interfaces
Finite volume methods implemented in Matlab to model solute diffusion at solid-solid interfaces, accounting for energy barriers and interfacial segregation. The derivation of the models has been published in: [F.D. León-Cázares and E.I. Galindo-Nava. Phys. Rev. Mat., 5 (2021) 123802](https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.123802). Please cite this publication if you benefit from this repository.
